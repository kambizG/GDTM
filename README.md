# GDTM - Graph-based Dynamic Topic Model

A graph-based online solution to the prblem of dynamic topic modeling (DTM).

## Description
GDTM is a single-pass DTM approach that combines a context-rich and incremental feature representation model, called *Random Indexing (RI)* with a novel online *graph partitioning* algorithm to address scalability and dynamicity in topic modeling over short texts. In addition, GDTM uses a rich language modeling approach based on the *Skip-gram* technique to account for sparsity.
